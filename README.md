Sustainable Workplace is an enterprise-based software to help large organizations reduce their carbon footprint and waste output. To do this, the web-based application tracks employees that participate in sustainable initiatives such as opting to reduce their carbon footprint by walking to the office or reducing their waste output by adopting the use of a reusable cup. The application has been built with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React frontend. The client application is deployed on Netlify and the server-side is deployed on Heroku.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to create a sustainable ecosystem for businesses, where employees are empowered and accountable to make environmentally conscious decisions. The application aims to help individuals and corporations overcome the challenges of adopting long-lasting sustainable change.

Businesses and their employees are conscious of their carbon footprint. Many of us want to live a more sustainable and green lifestyle however, sometimes we forget how much of an impact small over-sites impact the environment. A lot of us try actively to attempt to be more sustainable at home however when it comes to work we sometimes tend to forget. With our web application, we are able to visually show you your personal impact and sustainability efficiency over a period of time.

<br>

## Functionality / Features

The application consists of an employee dashboard page and an admin dashboard page, alongside a settings pop-up page. The application will prompt employees to input information during or at the end of a work shift.

All Users: The application will require all users to enter a username and password to be authenticated to access the application.

**All Users**: When authorized, users will have access to their dashboard containing information on their sustainability efforts.

- Create Account
- Display dashboard for information relevant to the account
- Create, delete and update daily sustainability figures
- Automatically update graphs upon user input
- Edit account information

<br>

## Target Audience

The target audience will be individuals aged between 20 - 44 in corporate workplaces who are aware of sustainability issues. To do this, the application will offer digital incentives in the form of an interactive dashboard. The objective is to turn the users' newly adopted behavior of bringing reusable cups and opting out of driving to work to become an everyday habit. Once employees begin to adopt this habit, they will be encouraged to become more environmentally conscious over time as they begin to see the cumulative impact of their change in behavior as well as the impact of the wider workforce.

<br>

## Testing

Our application has been tested on both Chrome and Firefox on macOS and Ubuntu.

Throughout the development of our application, we extensively implemented manual testing through Postman, and manual through the browser.

We also implemented RSpec to do some testing in our back-end. RSpec allowed us to ensure data was saving properly and authentication was working so we didn't have to manually do API calls each time we wanted to test something.

## Libraries and Dependencies

### Serverside dependencies and libraries

- Ruby on Rails: We used Ruby on Rails as a measure to communicate with our PostgreSQL database.
  Using Ruby on Rails we were able to create a back-end server we could make API requests.

- PostgreSQL: is a relational database, we used PostgreSQL to store all our data into specific tables based on information that we want to access

- Knock: Knock is an authentication solution for a Rails API application based on JSON Web Tokens
  knock allows to be able to easily authenticate users and allows us to be able to provide user authorization.

- Bcrypt: is a ruby gem that enables us to encrypt and decrypt user passwords. Bcrypt uses a sophisticated hashing algorithm and provides a simple wrapper for safely handling passwords.

- RSpec: is a testing framework for ruby. It allowed us to write automated tests for how our data moved and saved in the back end of this application.

- CORS: cors is a node.js package that enables CORS origin resource sharing. Using CORS enabled us to share and access resources between our Ruby on Rails server and our React client

### Clientside dependencies and libraries

- React: Is a Javascript Front-end library for building user interfaces or UI components.
  The client-side of this application was build using the React library.

- react-dom - is a complimentary library with react. React-dom allows us to bind react to the DOM. Doing so enables us to be able to use such methods as `render()` which allows us to display various components in the browser.

- material UI core, icons, lab: Material UI is a library that allows us to access and import different components to create an interactive user interface in our application. Material UI uses Material Design principles developed by Google.

- chart.js: is a library that provides us with components that we can use for charting. This library was used to develop the horizontal bar chart component you see in the dashboard.

- JSONpretty: is a code formater. We used to display JSON data in a neat format which enabled us to read return API calls easier.

### What we would have done differently and reasons for pivoting from our initial wireframes

As we have 7 tables in our database, and a lot of our databases are automatically populated with data depending on other tables' data. To get this working, and working in an efficient manner was not easy. We most likely would have made the back end a lot simpler by reducing our table count and prompting the user for more questions, rather than doing calculations storing data that way.

We pivoted from our initial wireframe dashboard design to a simpler one dashboard design that displays all user data and current user data. Doing so allowed us to focus more on the components we wanted to implement. We also realized that with the time restraints we had, having more charts as we did in our wireframes was not feasible.

We feel that what we have in our production app displays the data we want to show.

## Project management

Trello board link: https://trello.com/b/xR8n1vRM/full-stack-part-b

We used 2 different Trello boards for the first and second part of our application.
We used Trello so we could delegate parts of our application that needed to be done and who needed to do it. We set time dates we wanted to get certain features and components done by. However, running into a lot of issues not a lot of these deadlines were met.
